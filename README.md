## Dependencies

- Compiles only with **XeTeX** and required **BibTex** for compiling publications and the .bib filetype.

## TODO
1. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
4. Add location/address information
5. Fix the hacky 'References' omission outside the .cls file in the MacFonts version.
6. Add various styling and section options and allow for multiple pages smoothly.

## Known Issues:
1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the vertical limit
2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.
